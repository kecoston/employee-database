  ## Instillation 
  This application requires mysql, inquirer, and console.table

  ## User-Story 
  When the user initiates the program, they will need to run an npm install to make sure all the necessary programs have been installed. Once that is complete, they can run the server.js file in node.

  When the program opens, the user will be presented with a series of questions on what it is they would like to do, such as; view the current department or add a department. Using the arrow keys the user can select which task they would like to perform first. Most options will require the user to answer a series of questions related to the role, department, or employee.

The user's answers will be stored in the original database, which is run in mysql. When the user completes the requirements, they will then be direct back to the initial prompts. If they would like to end the program, they should select exit.

  ## What I Learn 
  This assignment was challenging. I would have loved to have completed the bonus questions but was not able to at this time. This assignment took a lot of thought and planning. This was due to the large amount of data that was being used over several different programs and zones of the coding. This was the first assignment that I worked with mySQL. First, I set up the database, I then set up the inquirer questions and initial prompts, and then I filled in the code between-which displayed the tables in inquirer, and pulled or pushed the data to mySQL. Moving forward, I would like to look at the possibility of using constructor functions and dive into the bonus point questions.
